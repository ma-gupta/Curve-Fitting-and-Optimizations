# Curve Fitting, Optimizations, and Finite Difference Methods

Coded with python, visual python, and python notebook languages and methods.
Utilizes least squares method, general curve fitting methods, and taylor series in finite difference methods to curve fit different physics data. Data is read from text files and is curve fit based on observable trends in the data and the formulas that relate to its collection (ie: radioactive decay, centripetal motion, etc.). Additional values are extrapolated to make curves smoother, as such the program is able to handle big data sets.

## Usage
This is a python notebook file and as such needs to be run through a notebook for the graphics to be visible
